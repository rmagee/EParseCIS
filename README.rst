A Pythonic Approach to Parsing EPCIS Data
-----------------------------------------

The EParseCIS python package utilizes the lxml python package along with
the EPCPyYes EPCIS python package to enable the quick and easy parsing of
EPCIS data from it's native format into python EPCPyYes class instances that
can be quickly manipulated, inspected and serialized to other formats with
minimal effort.
